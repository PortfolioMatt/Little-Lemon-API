1) Open command terminal (PowerShell)
2) cd Little-Lemon
3) pipenv install
4) pipenv run python LittleLemon\\manage.py migrate
5) pipenv run python LittleLemon\\manage.py runserver

Notes:
- Use "pipenv run" to ensure you're using the correct virtualenv.
- "makemigrations" is only needed if you changed models (migrations are already included in the repo).
